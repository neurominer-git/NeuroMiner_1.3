# NeuroMiner 1.2 Feanor

NeuroMiner has been continuously developed by [Nikolaos Koutsouleris](https://www.imprs-tp.mpg.de/person/43420/2484), [Clara Vetter](https://cdn0.scrvt.com/4d3e519fe5939342b95c7312343779ef/d44b9dca07ed3899/0915c2a47419/Clara_Vetter_CV.pdf) and [Ariane Wiegand](https://www.psych.mpg.de/person/123169/1496336) since 2009 to provide clinical researchers with cutting-edge machine learning methods for the analysis of heterogeneous data, such as clinical and neurocognitive read-outs, structural and functional neuroimaging data, and genetic information. 

The program is an interface to a large variety of unsupervised and supervised pattern recognition algorithms that have been developed in  the machine learning field over the last decades. Furthermore, the application implements different strategies for preprocessing, filtering and fusion of heterogeneous data, training ensembles of predictors, and for the visualization and testing of the significance of the computed predictive patterns. 

The current release 1.2 of NeuroMiner has been tested in the [Section for Precision Psychiatry at LMU Munich, Germany](https://www.lmu-klinikum.de/psychiatrie-und-psychotherapie/forschung-research/working-groups/precision-psychiatry/7ef67d79b4ad4804) on a variety of datasets containing healthy controls and patients with psychiatric disorders, and it was designed specifically to create robust models with a high probability of generalization to new datasets.
