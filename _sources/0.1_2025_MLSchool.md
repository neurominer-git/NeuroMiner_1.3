The Online Machine Learning School for Precision Medicine provides comprehensive training on machine learning (ML) methodologies for beginners, tailored to clinical research applications in psychiatry and neuroscience. This fully online course will take place from 3 to 7 November 2025, running daily from 09:30 to 17:00 CET.

The programme is designed to enhance participants' understanding of ML concepts through practical sessions and theoretical discussions. The course covers fundamental ML topics, including nested cross-validation, strategies to mitigate overfitting, external validation processes, and interpretability through explainable AI (XAI). Participants will also explore the TRIPOD-AI guidelines to enhance the reporting quality and transparency of ML research findings.  Additionally, specific attention will be devoted to challenges frequently encountered in psychiatric research, such as site-correction and data fusion techniques. The curriculum incorporates perspectives from guest speakers who will discuss ethical, practical, and regulatory issues relevant to integrating ML into clinical practice.  

Two participation tracks are available to accommodate different learning needs:

In-depth track: Includes access to seminars, expert lectures and hands-on tutorials and interactive workshops using NeuroMiner, a user-friendly ML toolbox developed for clinical neuroscience and neuroimaging research.

Basic track: Includes access to seminars and expert lectures only.

No prior coding knowledge is required, enabling broad accessibility to clinicians and researchers seeking to effectively incorporate ML into their work. The course is applicable to participants working with a wide variety of data including clinical, neuroimaging and genetic data.  

This course is organised under the lead of Prof. Nikolaos Koutsouleris and collaborators from LMU Munich, King’s College London, and the ECNP Neuroimaging Network.
